# yap

yap (stands for "Yet Another Provisioner") is a provisioning tool to quickly create a Kubernetes cluster (or multiple) depending on the preference. These clusters can be declartively set up either locally (using kind, minikube, k3d or colima) or remotely in cloud providers (AWS, GCP, and Azure).
